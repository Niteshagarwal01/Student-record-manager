## Core Algorithms Implemented

1. **Dynamic Singly Linked List (Memory Allocation):**
   * Implements dynamic node allocation for student records in heap memory.
   * Node insertion in O(1) time and sequential node traversal in O(n) time.

2. **Divide-and-Conquer Merge Sort ($O(n \log n)$):**
   * Stable recursive sorting mechanism applied to student aggregate scores and roll numbers.
   * Guarantees worst-case $O(n \log n)$ time complexity across all input distributions.

3. **Binary Search ($O(\log n)$):**
   * Logarithmic search space halving for roll number lookups over sorted contiguous arrays.
   * Reduces comparisons from 20 (worst-case linear scan) to at most 5 checks.

4. **Academic Performance Analytics:**
   * Dynamic visual bar charts mapping top 5 student performers against the batch mean line ($83.2\%$).
   * Departmental comparative analytics across Computer Science, IT, Electronics, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering.
   * Grade frequency distribution across distinction and division bands.

## Deployment on Netlify

This project is pre-configured for one-click continuous deployment on Netlify using the included `netlify.toml` and `netlify/functions/api.ts`.

### Steps:
1. Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
2. Click **Add new site** > **Import an existing project**.
3. Select **GitHub** and authorize access to `Niteshagarwal01/Student-record-manager`.
4. Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`:
   * **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   * **Publish Directory:** `dist/public`
   * **Functions Directory:** `netlify/functions`
5. Click **Deploy Site**.
